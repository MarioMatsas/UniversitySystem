# UniversitySystem
This project simulates a part of the site eclass.
It supports:
	Acceptance/Rejection by University Departments that a given student has applied to
	Communication between students and teachers (For assignments)
	A grading system and many other functions
While it isn't quite up to par with the real website, this programm can be easily expanded and made to be
an almost perfect copy of it (keeping in mind that it also contains functions that the real site doesn't support).
